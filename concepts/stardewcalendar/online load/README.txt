This was a concept where it loads all of the sprites and scripts separately. I ultimately decided to scrap it, but it's an interesting idea. It uses slightly less ram and could allow you to load specific sprites only when used, but for this specific project it's probably for the best if everything is loaded at once. 

I'm a scratch programmer, not a normal programmer, and I wanted to add this to change the way the loading screen works. I decided against it because you still have to wait at the bar for turbowarp to load, then another one. I could turn the bar off or possibly code my own loading screen, but I know very little about HTML coding. 

If I wanted to use less ram, I should probably resize all of the sprites to be 1/3 the size they are right now (by pixel), as everything is imported from the wiki (that's where I got the images for stages, crops, and seeds), and they are 3x. (I thought everything was 48 by 48, it's not.)

I'm trying to find a good way to do that that's not manually, but for now this is a bad idea - it takes a long time to load for very little bonus.
