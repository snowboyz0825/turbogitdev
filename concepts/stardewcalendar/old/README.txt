This is a very old version of the stardew calendar - I wanted to make a calendar simply because I needed it. I would constantly forget to pick ancient fruit and because I'm a neat freak I would wait for the next monday and lose out on 300000g of crops

I got sick of it, so I created this thing. I was a bad programmer and it was never really designed for public use. Most stuff has to be hard coded, or it pulls from a github directory or file. 

I'll add it as a website because I think it could be cool, but I think without directly diving into the source code, it's impossible to add anything or any real functionality (I think)

The only reason for it to pull from a (probably dead) github directory is because 1. I didn't understand JSON at the time and 2. I wanted to see if I could 

The new version is easily modifiable and should allow you to import new ones in the final version. This is a cool piece if history that took some effort to comment but have fun looking at it I guess
